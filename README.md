## Overview

This project is designed to familiarize myself with the process of building an ETL data pipeline using Python. I have chosen a dataset from Kaggle to practice data engineering tasks. This is for hands-on experience with processing data sets to understand data engineering workflows clearly.

## Objectives 

1. Extract data from a Kaggle dataset using the Kaggle API
2. Transform the data, including preprocessing 
3. Load the transformed data into a destination database (e.g Snowflake)
